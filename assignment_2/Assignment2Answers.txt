Question 1: array approach
Question 2: array approach
Question 3: array approach
Question 4: linked approach
Question 5: At first, the array approach seemed more efficient due to the fact
  that its items were more easily accessible. As the stacks got larger, the
  linked approach became more efficient as it did not have to incorporate
  resizing into its work. I was surprised to see that the linked approach took
  almost three times as much time to finish the "large push" test in comparison
  to the array approach, as I thought taking into consideration the time cost
  of resizing for the array approach would have a significant effect.
Question 6: Linked approach is better for stacks with larger amounts of items,
  while the array approach is better for stacks where the exact size is known.
